  <h1 style="margin-left: 2cm;">History and description</h1><br>

  <p style="margin-left: 1cm;">  Al Bayt Stadium, also known as Al Khor Stadium, is one of the recently opened new stadiums that was built to serve as a playing venue for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

  
</p>
<br>
<p style="margin-left: 1cm;">   First plans for Al Bayt Stadium were presented in 2014 and construction of the stadium began in late 2015.<br> The stadium officially opened on 30 November 2021 with a first round group match between Qatar and Bahrein during the 2021 Arab Cup. It also hosted the final of the same tournament, which was won by Algeria
</p>
<br>
<p style="margin-left: 1cm;">The design of the stadium reflects the inside of a Bedouin tent: coloured red, white, and black. These tents,<br> the bayt al shaâ€™ar, are also where the stadium gets its name from. The roof is retractable, opening and closing in 20 minutes.</p>
<br>
<p style="margin-left: 1cm;">Al Bayt Stadium has a capacity of roughly 60,000 seats, divided over three tiers. After the World Cup,<br> the top tier will be removed, reducing capacity to 32,000 seats.
</p>
<br>
<p style="margin-left: 1cm;">During the World Cup, the stadium will host a number of first round group matches, including the opening match, <br>and a round of 16, quarter-final, and semi-final match.
</p>
<h1 style="margin-left: 2cm;">How to get to albayt Stadium</h1><br>
<p style="margin-left: 1cm;">Al Bayt Stadium is located on the south-eastern edge of the small city of Al Khor City, which makes it the only FIFA World Cup stadium to not <br>be located in the wider Doha area.</p>
<br>
<p style="margin-left: 1cm;">Al Khor City is located on the Persion Gulf roughly 40 kilometres north of Doha. The distance from central Al Khor is about 4 kilometres.</p>
<br>
<p style="margin-left: 1cm;">Al Khor is not on the Doha metro network. For large events, shuttle buses typically run from Lusail QNB metro station, the northernmost station on the Red Line. The Red Line runs right through central Doha towards Hamad International Airport..</p>
