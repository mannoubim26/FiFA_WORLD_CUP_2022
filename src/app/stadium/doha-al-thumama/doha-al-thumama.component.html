 Construction of the stadium began in 2017 and took over four years. Al Thumama Stadium officially opened on 22 October 2021 with the 49th Amir Cup Final between Al-Sadd and Al-Rayyan (1-1).
 
 The stadiumâ€™s circular design has been inspired by the gahfiya, the traditional woven cap that is commonly worn by men across the Middle East.
